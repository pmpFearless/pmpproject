As i go down the road finding online templates for hosting my portfolio i found out about github, kaggle and others platform.

I've come to realize that with HTML, CSS and Javascript i could do many more things but those aren't my priority yet. It's fun to learn some basic in this portfolio creation. 

Big thanks to HTML5 UP for providing useful template used in my project portfolio

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
